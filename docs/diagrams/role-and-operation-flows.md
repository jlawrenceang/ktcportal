# KTC Online Portal — Role & Operation Flows

Detailed flowcharts of **every path each role can take**, the two operational spines
(Job Order + Release / Pull-out), and where the roles plug in. Diagrams are **Mermaid**
(render in GitHub, Obsidian, and most Markdown viewers).

**Source of truth:** synthesized from the live code + the **live `role_permissions`
table** and the SECURITY DEFINER RPC guards. Migrations through **0183** (the ADR-0035
job-order ops overhaul + the whole-app audit closure; verified 2026-06-27).

## How to read these

- **Rounded box** = screen/state. **Diamond** = decision/gate. **`[*]`** = start/terminal.
- Edge labels name the **action** and, in `[brackets]`, the **role/permission** that may take it.
- "Customer" = the accredited customs broker (non-staff). Staff roles: **owner, admin,
  operations, cashier, checker, csr**. **Owner bypasses every gate** (failsafe) and so is
  omitted from most edge labels — assume owner can do anything a gate allows.
- All writes go through **SECURITY DEFINER RPCs** gated by `has_permission()` (staff) or the
  `broker_*` helpers (customer); the UI only mirrors these — the server is the real gate.

## Roles, landings & permission matrix (verified against the live DB)

| Role | Lands on | Essence |
|---|---|---|
| **owner** | `/admin` | Failsafe — bypasses all gates; can edit the matrix itself |
| **admin** | `/admin` | Full back office; everything **except `confirm_xray`**; **approves** priority + re-X-ray; bills charges |
| **operations** | `/app/operations` | Accept orders + RPS + service completion + vessels; **monitors** X-ray (no confirm); **requests** priority / re-X-ray / charges; **no money, no file-on-behalf** |
| **cashier** | `/app/cashier` | **Money lane only** — payments + ERP invoice + **bills charges**; **no** accept/hold-reject/complete (dropped `0171`); **cannot** see the X-ray queue |
| **checker** | `/app/checker` | Confirms each van's X-ray entry (the spotter); **requests** re-X-ray |
| **csr** | `/app/support` | Support inbox + file-on-behalf + release doc verification + consignee request review + **requests** priority; **never** changes order status |
| **purchaser** | (appmap pending) | Fuel module: procurement + monitoring; **scoped, non-admin** |
| **customer** | `/` | Files/pays own Job Orders & Releases; sees only own data |

> **Landing change (current):** operational roles now land on their **focused staff-PWA screen** (`/app/*`),
> not the `/admin/*` page — the full back office is one tap away via "Open full portal". Only **owner/admin**
> land on `/admin`. (`RoleLanding`, `src/App.tsx`.)

Permission matrix (`✓` allowed · blank = denied · owner = `✓` on all):

**ADR-0035 maker-checker gates** (`0171`–`0177`): the six request/approve rows —
`request_priority`/`approve_priority`, `request_rexray`/`approve_rexray`,
`request_supplement`/`bill_supplement` — split *propose* from *approve/bill* so a requester can
never self-approve. **`0171` separation of duties:** CSR lost `accept_orders` / `hold_reject_orders`
(intake + comms only); cashier lost `hold_reject_orders` / `complete_orders` (money lane only).
**Completion is now automatic** — no role clicks "complete"; the order self-completes when the last
gate (services *or* payment) lands. **Confirming a base payment requires the ERP invoice + BIR pad
serial on file** (`record_service_invoice`, `0177`/`0178`).

## 1. Whole-operation overview

How a shipment moves through the portal, and which role drives each leg. Two independent
spines share one customer account and one back office.

## 2. Job Order spine — state machine

States: `held · submitted · processing · on_hold · completed · rejected · cancelled`.

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted: approved customer / CSR-on-behalf files (jo_number + serving no. assigned)
    submitted --> processing: accept_orders [operations/admin]
    submitted --> on_hold: hold_reject_orders [ops/admin]
    submitted --> rejected: hold_reject_orders [ops/admin]
    submitted --> cancelled: cancel_job_order [customer]
    processing --> on_hold: hold_reject_orders [ops/admin]
    processing --> rejected: hold_reject_orders [ops/admin]
    on_hold --> submitted: resubmit_needs_info [customer, field-targeted]
    on_hold --> cancelled: cancel_job_order [customer]
    processing --> completed: TWO-GATE met — AUTO (services + payments)
    rejected --> [*]: terminal (no resubmit; use the on_hold path)
    cancelled --> [*]
    completed --> [*]
    note right of submitted
      held is legacy — pending customers are now
      verify-only (0163) and can no longer file
    end note
    note right of completed
      a charge billed after completion does NOT
      revert it (0183) — stays completed, flagged
      has_open_supplement until the charge is paid
    end note
```

**TWO-GATE completion** (`jo_ready_to_complete` + the `complete_on_payment_confirmed` /
`complete_on_service_done` triggers + `enforce_two_gate_complete` backstop) — `processing → completed`
fires **automatically** (no role clicks "complete") when **all** hold:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    G1["All service lines done<br/>X-ray: every van confirmed [checker]<br/>DEA/OOG: [operations]"]
    G2["Base payment confirmed<br/>[cashier · review_payments]<br/>(ERP invoice + BIR pad recorded first)"]
    G3["RPS cleared<br/>not needed, OR paid+confirmed"]
    G4["Every BILLED supplement confirmed<br/>JO-####-A/B/C… (un-priced 'requested' don't block)"]
    G1 --> DONE{{"all true?"}}
    G2 --> DONE
    G3 --> DONE
    G4 --> DONE
    DONE -->|"yes — auto"| C["completed + completed_at stamped"]
    DONE -->|"any open"| P["stays processing"]
```

### 2a. Serving lanes + escalations — priority & re-X-ray (ADR-0035)

The serving number is assigned/vacated **automatically** on status (`serving_numbers_on_status`, `0173`):
it lands on `submitted`/`processing` and vacates (→ off the board) on `on_hold`/`rejected`/`cancelled`/`completed`.
Returning to the line gets a **new tail number** (the manual `restore_serving_number` queue-jump was dropped,
`0182`). Three lanes run in parallel — **regular**, a **priority** lane served first, and a **re-X-ray** child
lane — each numbered independently; the checker/operations queue sorts **priority → regular → re-X-ray**.

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    SUB["submitted / processing<br/>(regular lane)"]
    SUB -->|"request_priority [csr/ops]"| PREQ["priority: requested"]
    PREQ -->|"review_priority approve [admin]"| PGR["priority: granted<br/>→ priority lane (served ahead)"]
    PREQ -->|"review_priority deny [admin]"| SUB

    DONE2["completed order"]
    DONE2 -->|"request_rexray [checker/ops]<br/>builds child JO-####A"| RREQ["child: rexray_status=requested<br/>(customer-invisible, can't cancel/edit)"]
    RREQ -->|"review_rexray approve [admin]<br/>(+ billable?)"| RAP["child processing → re-X-ray lane<br/>own per-van X-ray + lifecycle"]
    RREQ -->|"review_rexray deny [admin]"| RCAN["child cancelled"]
    RAP -->|"free (default): services-done completes<br/>billable: + payment"| RDONE["child completed"]
```

> A re-X-ray child can't be X-rayed before admin approval (`record_van_xray` guard, `0181`), can't be
> accepted via the generic `accept_orders` path (`0178`), and emits **no** customer notifications (it's
> internal); `request_rexray`/`request_supplement` instead **ping staff** by gate (`notify_staff`, `0183`).

---

## 3. Release / Pull-out spine — state machine

States: `submitted · docs_verified · payable · paid · released · on_hold · cancelled`.
Customer must be **approved** to file (no held/pending path, unlike JOs).

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> submitted: file_release_order [approved customer] (RO-###### assigned)
    submitted --> docs_verified: verify ok [csr/admin · verify_release_docs]
    submitted --> on_hold: verify rejects doc [verify_release_docs]
    on_hold --> submitted: resubmit_release_doc [customer]
    docs_verified --> payable: set_release_charges — SET ONCE, non-zero [verify_release_docs]
    payable --> paid: submit_release_payment [customer] then confirm_release_payment [cashier]
    paid --> released: record_release_or [cashier · review_payments/record_invoice]
    submitted --> cancelled: cancel_release_order [customer/staff]
    docs_verified --> cancelled: cancel_release_order [customer/staff]
    payable --> cancelled: cancel_release_order [customer/staff]
    on_hold --> cancelled: cancel_release_order [customer/staff]
    released --> [*]
    cancelled --> [*]
```

**Additional charges & the OR block** — base charge is set **once**; anything missed is a
**supplement** the customer pays separately, and the **OR is blocked until every supplement
is confirmed**:

```mermaid
flowchart LR
    A["add_release_charge<br/>[csr/admin · verify_release_docs]<br/>on payable or paid"] --> S["release_supplements row (unpaid)"]
    S -->|"customer uploads proof"| SUB["submitted"]
    SUB -->|"confirm [cashier · review_payments]"| CONF["confirmed"]
    SUB -->|"reject"| REJ["rejected → customer re-uploads"]
    REJ --> SUB
    CONF --> OR{{"record_release_or:<br/>all supplements confirmed?"}}
    OR -->|"yes + OR no.(≤6) + ERP OR-INV(8), non-zero, cash"| REL["released"]
    OR -->|"any unpaid"| BLOCK["BLOCKED — settle first"]
```

```

**Customer is blocked from:** filing anything while **pending** (verify-only, `0163`); editing an order
once `processing`; cancelling once `processing` (JO) or once `paid` (release); resubmitting a `rejected`
order (terminal — use the field-targeted `on_hold` path); touching an internal **re-X-ray** child;
requesting or pricing charges; confirming any payment; filing a Release while not `approved`.
